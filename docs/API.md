# API (v0 contract)

Status: ✅ = implemented and merged on `main` (backend core, social, items wave 2, insights wave 2, Google sign-in, multi-audience requests; migrations `0001`-`0006`). Base URL:
`http://127.0.0.1:5055`. JSON in/out, `snake_case`, ISO-8601 UTC timestamps (`...Z`). Auth:
`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` (HS256, 30-day expiry) on everything except `/health`, `/auth/signup`, `/auth/login` and `/auth/oauth/google` (`DELETE /auth/me` needs the token).
Errors always: `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}` (including 404/405/413/500).
UUID path ids that are malformed return 404. Numeric money/weight fields serialise as JSON numbers.

| Status | `code` values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `validation_error` | Bad/missing fields, any string containing a NUL (`\u0000`) anywhere in a JSON body, over-long strings (limits below), e.g. `waste_reason` on a non-`thrown_out` removal |
| 401 | `unauthorized`, `invalid_credentials`, `invalid_token` | `unauthorized`: missing/invalid/expired bearer token (the only code the auth guard emits); `invalid_credentials`: bad login; `invalid_token`: rejected Google ID token (`POST /auth/google` only) |
| 403 | `forbidden`, `email_not_verified` | Authenticated but not your item / not a member of that group / not the owner or author; Google account email not verified |
| 404 | `not_found` | Not found (also for removed items on `PATCH`) |
| 405 | `method_not_allowed` | |
| 409 | `not_removed`, `restore_window_expired`, `already_removed`, `already_shared`, `email_taken`, `already_friends`, `request_pending`, `already_member`, `already_claimed`, `listing_closed`, `request_closed`, `account_exists_use_password`, `identity_conflict` | Conflict |
| 413 | `payload_too_large` | Upload over 10 MB |
| 500 | `internal_error` | Unhandled error |
| 502 | `upstream_unavailable` | Gemini / ML service / Open Food Facts / Google JWKS unavailable or not configured |
| 503 | `oauth_not_configured` | `POST /auth/oauth/google` while `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_IDS` is unset |

### Input limits and path ids

String caps (over-limit -> `400 validation_error`): item `name` 200, item `unit` 32, `display_name` 60, `email` 254 (signup, login, `POST /friends`), `password` 256 (signup min 8; login max 256), group `name` 60, `invite_code` 64, request `text` 280. A malformed path id is `404 not_found` naming the resource ("Item/Group/User/Request/Listing not found.").

`POST /recipes/suggest`: the body goes through the same JSON-object check as every endpoint (any `\u0000` in any string -> `400 validation_error`); `dietary` has at most 10 entries of at most 40 characters each (`400` otherwise).

Group pantry items: editing (`PATCH`), removing and restoring them (single and batch) needs CURRENT group membership, including for the user who added them. Ex-member: single endpoints `403 forbidden`; batch endpoints `404 not_found` (whole batch, no existence leak). An ex-member's old group items are also excluded from `POST /recipes/suggest` (an `item_ids` entry naming one -> `404 not_found`, like an unknown id) and from `GET /tips` (expiry observations); `GET /people/reachable?item_id=` for such an item -> `404 not_found`. `GET /impact` is unchanged: it counts the user's own past food events.

## Health
- ✅ `GET /health` → `200 {"status": "ok"}`

## Auth
- ✅ `POST /auth/signup` `{email (<=254), password (8-256 chars), display_name (<=60)}` → `201 {token, user}`;
  `409 email_taken`. Emails are case-insensitive.
- ✅ `POST /auth/login` `{email, password}` → `200 {token, user}`; `401 invalid_credentials`. An
  account created through Google has no password, so email login for it is also
  `401 invalid_credentials` (same message as a wrong password).
- ✅ `POST /auth/oauth/google` `{id_token}` (the Google Sign-In iOS SDK's `idToken`) →
  `{token, user, created}` (`token`/`user` as for login). **`201` with `"created": true` when this call
  created a new BiteDown account, `200` with `"created": false` when it signed in an existing one.**
  The token is verified on the server against Google's JWKS
  (`https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs`, keys cached per `Cache-Control: max-age`; an unknown
  `kid` forces an early refetch **at most once per 30 s**, otherwise it is `401 invalid_token`; a
  malformed JWKS document counts as unavailable): RS256 signature, `aud` ∈ `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_IDS` (comma-separated env),
  `iss` ∈ {`accounts.google.com`, `https://accounts.google.com`}, `exp`/`iat` with 60 s leeway,
  `sub` and `email` present, `email_verified` true (JSON `true`, or the string `"true"` in any case; the
  same rule is used for linking below). Account resolution, in order:
  1. an identity `(provider=google, subject=sub)` exists → sign in its user (`200`), whatever the
     email domain (the same Google account signing in again always works);
  2. else, if a user with the same email (case-insensitive) exists:
     a. that user already has a google identity with a different `sub` → `409 identity_conflict`
        (one Google identity per user), nothing written;
     b. else, auto-link only when `email_verified` is true **and** (the email domain is `gmail.com` or
        `googlemail.com`, case-insensitive, whatever `hd` says, **or** the token's `hd` claim (Google
        Workspace domain) is a string equal to the email's domain, case-insensitive and trimmed; an `hd`
        naming any other domain, or a non-string / empty `hd`, does not count) → a new google identity is linked and the user signed in (`200`); a password
        account keeps its password;
     c. otherwise → `409 account_exists_use_password` ("log in with your email and password"),
        nothing written;
  3. else (no user with that email) create a user (`password_hash` null, `display_name` = token
     `name`, else `given_name`, else the email's local part; max 80 chars) plus the identity (`201`),
     for any domain.
  The matched user row is locked (`FOR UPDATE`) while linking, and a lost first-sign-in race
  (unique violation) is rolled back and re-resolved once with the same rules, so concurrent requests
  can neither create two users nor attach two google identities to one user.
  Errors: `400 validation_error` (missing/non-string/empty `id_token`, non-object body);
  `409 identity_conflict` / `409 account_exists_use_password` (rules 2a / 2c);
  `401 invalid_token` (malformed, bad signature, unknown key, wrong `aud`/`iss`, expired, issued in the
  future, or missing any of `iat`, `exp`, `iss`, `aud`, `sub`, `email`); `403 email_not_verified`;
  `502 upstream_unavailable` (JWKS fetch failed or returned no usable keys, and no keys are cached; with
  a stale cache the cached keys are used); `503 oauth_not_configured` (`GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_IDS` unset).
  **Check order:** body validation (`400`) → not configured (`503`) → token verification (`401`/`403`/
  `502`) → account resolution (`409`). So a bad body is `400` even when Google sign-in is not
  configured. Concurrent first sign-ins with the same account resolve to one user.
- `user` = `{id, email, display_name, created_at}`.
- ✅ `GET /auth/me` (Bearer) → `200 {user, has_password, providers}`; `user` as above. `has_password` is
  true when the account has a password (email login works), false for a Google-only account.
  `providers` lists the linked sign-in providers, sorted, `[]` when none (e.g. `["google"]`). Password
  hashes and provider subjects are never returned. `401 unauthorized` for a missing, invalid or expired
  token, or a deleted user.
  ```json
  {"user": {"id": "…", "email": "a@b.co", "display_name": "Ana", "created_at": "2026-10-10T12:00:00Z"},
   "has_password": false, "providers": ["google"]}
  ```
- ✅ `DELETE /auth/me` (Bearer) → `204` (App Store account deletion). One transaction. **Deleted:** the
  user, their items (including ones in group pantries), every listing on those items and their own
  listings, friendships (both directions), group memberships, requests they wrote, their linked sign-in identities (`user_identities`). **Detached:** listings
  they claimed/received elsewhere get `claimed_by`/`recipient_id` null (open again); requests they
  fulfilled are reopened; ownership of groups they owned passes to the longest-standing remaining
  member and `groups.created_by` becomes null (`created_by: null` in group responses). **Anonymised:**
  their `food_events` keep every number but `user_id` becomes the nil UUID
  `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`, so aggregates survive with no personal link. The same JWT
  then fails with `401 unauthorized`; login fails with `401 invalid_credentials`. A later Google
  sign-in with the same Google account creates a fresh user (`201`).

## Items
An **item** is `{id, owner_id, group_id, name, category, storage, quantity, unit, est_weight_kg,
est_price, source, added_at, predicted_expiry (date), expiry_source, removed_at, outcome,
waste_reason, removed_after_expiry, freshness, freshness_checked_at, confidence, nutrition, share}`
(`expiry_source` ∈ `default|gemini|ml|user`). `category` ∈ `produce_leafy, produce_hardy, dairy, meat,
seafood, bakery, eggs, leftovers, pantry_dry, frozen, other`; `storage` ∈ `fridge|pantry|freezer`;
`source` ∈ `photo|single_photo|text|barcode|receipt|manual`.
- **Numeric bounds** (create and `PATCH`, BE-9): `est_price` 0..99,999,999.99 (column is
  `numeric(10,2)`), `quantity` >0..1,000,000, `est_weight_kg` 0..100,000. Out of range, negative,
  non-numeric or non-finite → `400 validation_error`, nothing written (never a 500).
- `freshness` (`fresh|semi_fresh|spoiled|null`) and `freshness_checked_at` (timestamp of the last
  assessment, null iff `freshness` is null): stored when a create payload carries `freshness`
  (validated via `candidates.normalize_freshness`: variants such as `rotten` map, unknown strings become
  `fresh` with a WARNING, a non-string is `400`); `freshness_checked_at` = now. `confidence` is the
  detector's 0..1 score (create only; `400` outside 0..1), null for manual items. All three are on
  every item response.
- `nutrition` (`object|null`): a per-100 g nutrition estimate,
  `{basis: "per_100g", kcal (int), protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g, fiber_g?, sugar_g?, sodium_mg?, estimated: true}`.
  The four core keys match the recipe `macros` object, which is per serving. Stored when a create payload
  carries it (the candidate round trip), validated by `services/nutrition.py`: kcal 0..900, grams 0..100,
  sodium 0..40,000 mg, protein + carbs + fat <= 105 g, and kcal within max(40 %, 30 kcal) of 4P + 4C + 9F.
  Anything else (not an object, another `basis`, a missing or non-numeric core key, an invalid optional key,
  an implausible mix) → `400 validation_error`, nothing written. `estimated` is always stored as `true`,
  unknown keys are dropped, and an explicit `null` means "none". On every item response; `null` when unknown.
  Not editable (`PATCH` → `400`).
- `share` is present on the **owner's own** items (`GET /items`, also with `group_by`; create, `PATCH`,
  `remove`, `restore` responses) and is `{id, status (open|fulfilled), claimed_by: {id, name} | null, audience}` for
  the item's most recent **non-cancelled** listing, else `null`. Loaded with two queries for the whole
  list (listings, then the names of the listing groups; no N+1). The group pantry
  (`GET /groups/:id/pantry`) and other users' views do **not** include it (nor `audience`).
  `share.audience` = `{friends: bool, groups: [{id, name}]}` says who the listing is visible to: a
  friends-listing (`group_id` null) is `{"friends": true, "groups": []}`, a group listing is
  `{"friends": false, "groups": [{"id": "…", "name": "Flat 4B"}]}`. Present wherever the owner gets `share`: `GET /items` (also
  `group_by`), `PATCH`, `remove`, `restore` and the batch variants.
  ```json
  "share": {"id": "…", "status": "open", "claimed_by": null,
            "audience": {"friends": false, "groups": [{"id": "…", "name": "Flat 4B"}]}}
  ```

- ✅ `GET /items?storage=fridge|pantry|freezer&include_removed=false` → `200 {items}` sorted by
  `predicted_expiry`, then `added_at`. Only the caller's **personal** items (`group_id` null; group-pantry items are listed by `GET /groups/:id/pantry`). Invalid `storage` → 400.
- ✅ `POST /items` `{items: [{name, category?, storage?, quantity?, unit?, est_price?, est_weight_kg?,
  predicted_expiry?, source?, group_id?}], group_id?}` → `201 {items}` (1-100 items). A top-level `group_id` applies to every item; a per-item `group_id` overrides it. A group `group_id` puts the item in that group's pantry; caller must be a member (`403` otherwise, `404` unknown group; nothing written). Defaults: category `other`, storage
  `fridge`, quantity 1, unit `piece`, source `manual`. Invalid enum/negative number → 400 and nothing
  is written. One `add` event per item, same transaction. If `predicted_expiry` is omitted the
  backend predicts it: Gemini batch estimate when configured (`expiry_source=gemini`), else the
  default shelf-life table (`default`); a client-supplied expiry is stored as `user`.
  `est_weight_kg` is estimated from quantity/unit/category when absent.
  **Candidate round trip:** post a candidate back as-is, including `expiry_source`
  (`default|gemini|ml`), and that source is **kept** when `predicted_expiry` is sent. Edit detection is
  client-driven and the server trusts the enum: the client sends `expiry_source: "user"` (or omits the
  field, which defaults to `user`) once the person changed the date. Invalid value → `400`; a
  `expiry_source` sent without `predicted_expiry` is ignored (the backend predicts and sets it).
  `freshness`, `confidence` and `nutrition` from the candidate are stored (see above).
- ✅ `PATCH /items/:id` — body may contain `name, quantity, unit, storage, category, food_group,
  predicted_expiry, est_price, est_weight_kg, freshness` (unknown fields → 400, so `confidence` and
  `nutrition` are not editable). `freshness` set → stored and `freshness_checked_at` = now; `freshness: null` clears **both**
  (null means "never assessed"). Changing the expiry sets
  `expiry_source=user`. Changing quantity/unit/category re-estimates `est_weight_kg` unless sent.
  → `200 {item}`; `403` other user's item; `404` unknown or already removed.
- ✅ `POST /items/:id/remove` — **the core endpoint**
  ```json
  {"outcome": "used" | "donated" | "thrown_out",
   "waste_reason": "expired" | "didnt_like" | "forgot" | "other",   // required iff thrown_out
   "recipient_id": "uuid" | null}                                   // optional, donated only (see below)
  ```
  → `200 {item}`. Order of checks: body validation (400) → item lookup (404) → ownership (403) →
  already removed (409 `already_removed`). One transaction (row-locked): sets `removed_at`,
  `outcome`, `waste_reason`, `removed_after_expiry` (removed date > `predicted_expiry`); writes
  exactly one `remove` event (`co2e_kg`, weight, price, outcome, reason); on `donated`, marks the
  item's open share listing `fulfilled` (+`recipient_id`, `fulfilled_at`). A 4xx writes no event.
  **`recipient_id` has three cases** (donated only; the key present with `used`/`thrown_out`, even
  as null, is `400 validation_error`; a malformed id is `400`):
  1. *Key omitted*: an open listing that was claimed is fulfilled with `recipient_id` = the claimer;
     an unclaimed one, or no listing, gets none.
  2. *Explicit `"recipient_id": null`* ("someone not on BiteDown"): any open listing is fulfilled with
     `recipient_id` null, **even if it was claimed**; the claim does not redirect the gift.
  3. *A user id*: must be an accepted friend of the caller or a current member of a group the caller
     is in, with or without a listing; anyone else or an unknown id is `404 not_found` (nothing
     written). An open listing is fulfilled with that recipient. The caller's own id is
     `400 validation_error` ("You can't give food to yourself.").
  The recipient check runs after the item lookup/`409 already_removed`, before any write.
  `donated` is always saved and counts the same in `/impact` whatever the recipient; the `remove`
  event does not store the recipient (it lives only on the listing). **Group-pantry items (`group_id` set) can be
  removed by any member of that group**; the `remove` event's `user_id` is the *remover* and carries
  the item's `group_id`, so impact is credited to whoever removed it. Personal items of other users
  stay `403`; non-members of the group get `403`. `PATCH` stays owner-only. If the item's open
  listing was claimed and `recipient_id` is omitted, the claimer becomes `recipient_id`.

- ✅ `POST /items/:id/restore` (no body) → `200 {item}`. Undoes a removal made less than **10 minutes**
  ago (same permission as remove: owner, or any member for a group-pantry item). `409 not_removed` if
  the item is active, `409 restore_window_expired` after 10 minutes, `403`/`404` as for remove. One
  transaction under the row lock: clears `removed_at`, `outcome`, `waste_reason`,
  `removed_after_expiry`; **deletes the item's `remove` event** (by id + time) so `/impact`, `/tips` and
  any other event query are automatically correct; and if the removal fulfilled a listing
  (`fulfilled_at == removed_at`) the listing goes back to `open` with `fulfilled_at` and `recipient_id`
  cleared (`claimed_by` kept). The `share` event from listing creation is untouched.

- ✅ `POST /items/remove-batch` `{"item_ids": ["uuid", …] (1-100, unique), "outcome": "used" | "donated", "recipient_id": "uuid" | null}`
  → `200 {items: [item…]}` (request order; `share` on the caller's own items). **All or nothing.**
  `thrown_out` is not allowed here (it needs a per-item `waste_reason`; use the single endpoint), and so
  are `waste_reason` / any other field (`400`). `recipient_id` is optional and only for `donated`
  (present with `used` is `400`); same three cases as `POST /items/:id/remove`, applied to every item:
  omitted = each item's open listing goes to its own claimer; `null` = every open listing fulfilled
  with no recipient, claimed or not; a user id = friend / shared-group member else `404` for the whole
  batch (checked once, no per-item queries); own id = `400` "You can't give food to yourself.". Order of checks: body validation (400:
  empty/oversized/duplicate/malformed ids, bad outcome, unknown field) → lookup + visibility (**`404
  not_found` for the whole batch** if any id is unknown or not removable by the caller: another user's
  personal item, or a group-pantry item of a group you are not in) → `409 already_removed` if any item is
  already removed. Otherwise one transaction with all rows locked (`FOR UPDATE`, id order): same per-item
  effects as `POST /items/:id/remove` (one `remove` event each, `user_id` = caller, same `removed_at` for
  the batch); `donated` fulfils each item's open listing (recipient per the rules above). A 4xx
  writes nothing. Constant query count regardless of batch size.
- ✅ `POST /items/restore-batch` `{"item_ids": [...]}` (same id rules) → `200 {items}`. All or nothing:
  `404` as above, `409 not_removed` if any item is active, `409 restore_window_expired` if any removal is
  older than 10 minutes. Otherwise mirrors `POST /items/:id/restore` per item (deletes its `remove`
  event, reopens a listing that removal fulfilled). `remove-batch` then `restore-batch` leaves `/impact`
  exactly as before. Items removed singly can be restored in a batch and vice versa.

## Food groups (`food_group`)
`food_group` is the user-facing grouping: `protein | veggies | fruit | dairy | grains | pantry |
leftovers | frozen | other`. It is separate from the spoilage `category` (which still drives expiry and
CO2e). Returned on every item response and every candidate (parse-text, from-photo, from-receipt,
barcode). `POST /items` and `PATCH /items/:id` accept it (invalid -> `400 validation_error`); when
omitted on create it is derived from `category` + name (meat/seafood/eggs -> protein, bakery -> grains,
pantry_dry -> pantry, dairy/leftovers/frozen/other -> same name, produce_* -> `fruit` if the name is a
known fruit else `veggies`).
**PATCH rules:** (1) an explicit `food_group` always wins (valid value, else `400`), including when
`category` is sent in the same request; (2) `category` without `food_group` re-derives `food_group`
from the new category + current name (this overwrites a previous manual choice); (3) a `name`-only
change does **not** re-derive (the user's grouping is left alone); `name` + `category` re-derives. Sending `"food_group": null` returns `400` (to clear a manual group, send `category` again so it re-derives).
Receipt lines (`from-receipt`) without a Gemini category get their `food_group` from a deterministic keyword
match on whole, case-insensitive name tokens (with receipt abbreviations such as `CHKN`, `GRND BF`,
`YGRT`, `BRD`, `FROZ`, `MLK`, `OJ`, `TOM`, `SLMN` expanded): frozen, then pantry modifiers (juice, sauce, broth, soup, peanut
butter...), dairy, protein, grains, fruit, common vegetables, other pantry staples; no match -> `other`.
No Gemini call is involved. Tables: `backend/app/services/food_group.py`.
Candidates use the ML service's `food_group` when present, else Gemini's (validated), else the heuristic.
- ✅ `GET /items?group_by=food_group` (only valid value; anything else -> `400`) →
  `200 {sections: [{food_group, items: [item…]}]}`. Sections follow the Fridge design order
  (protein, veggies, fruit, dairy, then grains, pantry, leftovers, frozen, other); **empty sections
  are omitted**; items within a section sort by `predicted_expiry` ascending (nulls last). Other
  filters (`storage`, `include_removed`) still apply. Without `group_by` the response is unchanged
  (`{items: [...]}`).

## Adding food
Candidates are **not saved** until `POST /items`. Every candidate also carries a suggested
`storage`, `quantity`, `unit`, `est_price`, `predicted_expiry` and `expiry_source` so the client can
post it straight back.
- ✅ `POST /items/parse-text` `{text (<=4000 chars)}` → `200 {candidates: [item…]}` (Gemini);
  `502 upstream_unavailable` when Gemini is not configured/failing.
- **Image uploads (`from-photo`, `from-receipt`).** The `image` bytes are checked before any Gemini or ML call.
  Accepted: JPEG, PNG, WEBP and HEIC/HEIF (HEIC is recognised by its `ftyp` brand, since Pillow here has no HEIF decoder;
  it is forwarded as `image/heic`). Anything else (a text file renamed `.jpg`, PDF, GIF, a cut-off JPEG/PNG, a
  decompression bomb) → `400 validation_error` ("image must be a JPEG, PNG, WEBP or HEIC photo.") with no upstream
  call. Empty or missing → `400`; over 10 MB → `413`. The MIME type sent to Gemini/ML is derived from the bytes, not
  from the client's `Content-Type` part header.
- ✅ `POST /items/from-photo` multipart `image` (required), `mode=fridge|single` (default `fridge`) →
  `200 {candidates: [{name, category, confidence, freshness: "fresh"|"semi_fresh"|"spoiled", bbox: [x1,y1,x2,y2]|null,
  …}], source: "yolo"|"gemini"}`. Uses `ML_SERVICE_URL`/detect when set; if unset **or the ML
  service errors**, falls back to Gemini vision; neither → `502`.
  `freshness` is normalised server-side for both sources (`candidates.normalize_freshness`): the
  three values pass through; variants map `semi-fresh`/`semi fresh`/`use soon`/… → `semi_fresh`
  and `rotten`/`stale`/`moldy`/`overripe`/`decayed`/… → `spoiled` (case/hyphen/space-insensitive; the word
  lists mirror `SEMI_WORDS`/`SPOILED_WORDS` in `ml/yolo/taxonomy.py`, and `ripe` is fresh in both); anything unknown or
  missing becomes `fresh` and logs a WARNING (`freshness_fallback raw=… source=yolo|gemini`). On its own it
  is informational on the candidate and does not change `predicted_expiry` (with `enrich=expiry`, below,
  Gemini's estimate can); post it back with `POST /items` to store it on the item (`freshness`,
  `freshness_checked_at`).
  **Enrichment (opt-in).** Optional form field `enrich` = comma list of `expiry`, `nutrition`. Absent or empty →
  the response is exactly as above and Gemini is not called; an unknown name → `400 validation_error`, before
  anything runs. With it, **one** Gemini call (`gemini.enrich_items`, `purpose=enrich`, 25 s client timeout)
  answers for the candidates worth asking about: not `spoiled`, confidence unknown or ≥ 0.5, candidates with the
  same (name, category, storage, freshness) share one question and one answer, at most 12 questions, most
  confident first.
  - *What Gemini sees.* With `source: "yolo"`, a **crop** of each detection cut from the uploaded photo. `bbox`
    is in the raw pixel frame that `ml/serve` decoded (RGB, no EXIF transpose), so the crop is cut there and then
    rotated upright by the photo's EXIF orientation; the longest side is at most 512 px; it is re-encoded as JPEG,
    which drops EXIF, GPS and any JPEG comment; nothing is stored. A candidate with no usable box (missing, malformed, mostly
    outside the image, under 32 px), an undecodable or over-50-megapixel upload, and everything on
    `source: "gemini"` (there are no boxes) are asked **text-only** (name, category, storage, freshness).
  - *What comes back.* `expiry` → `predicted_expiry` = today + days and `expiry_source: "gemini"`, with days
    clamped to `0..min(3650, 2 × the default table value + 3)`: Gemini may shorten a date freely but not stretch it
    far. `nutrition` → the per-100 g object (see Items), or `null`; the `nutrition` key is on every candidate
    whenever it was requested. An answer that is missing or fails validation leaves the table values. Numbers only:
    Gemini returns no free text, so words printed on a label in a photo cannot reach the app.
  - *`enrichment`* is added to the response: `{status, requested: ["expiry", "nutrition"], enriched, total, reason}`.
    `status` is `ok` (every candidate got something), `partial`, `skipped` (no call made) or `failed`; `reason` is
    `null`, `not_configured` (no Gemini key), `time_budget` (detection alone took over 30 s), `no_eligible`,
    `upstream_error`, `unusable_response` or `unexpected_error`. **Enrichment never changes the HTTP status:**
    any failure is a `200` with the table dates. The enrich call is never retried (one attempt, 25 s at most), so
    the worst case is detection (skipped past 30 s) plus 25 s. The app should allow this request at least 60 s.
  - *Settings* (app config, defaults shown): `ENRICH_MAX_ITEMS` 12, `ENRICH_CROP_MAX_PX` 512, `ENRICH_TIMEOUT_S` 25,
    `ENRICH_MAX_PIXELS` 50,000,000, `ENRICH_SKIP_AFTER_S` 30, and `ML_BBOX_FRAME` `raw` (set `upright` if
    `ml/serve` ever applies the EXIF transpose before detecting).
  - *Log.* One INFO line on `app.enrich` per request: status, reason, source, facets and counts only, never a food
    name or an image. The Gemini call itself writes the usual `gemini_usage` line.
- ✅ `POST /items/from-receipt` multipart `image` → `200 {candidates: [item…], total, categorized_by:
  "gemini"|"heuristic"}` via `ML_SERVICE_URL`/ocr; `502` when unset or failing. Each candidate is a full
  item like the other add paths (`name, category, food_group, storage, quantity, unit, est_price,
  predicted_expiry, expiry_source`) plus `price` (= `est_price`, kept for older clients) and
  `receipt_text` (the line as printed), so it can be posted straight back to `POST /items`.
  With Gemini configured, **one call per receipt** (`gemini.categorize_receipt_lines`, JSON schema with the
  category / food_group / storage enums) turns abbreviated lines into readable names (`GV WHL MILK GAL` →
  `Whole milk`) with category, food group and storage. Without Gemini, or if that call fails, `name` stays
  as printed and the category comes from the food-group heuristic below (`categorized_by: "heuristic"`):
  dairy→dairy, grains→bakery, pantry→pantry_dry, fruit/veggies→produce_leafy (short-life on purpose),
  protein→seafood/eggs/meat by keyword, else `other`. Numbers may arrive as strings (`"$3.48"`, `"1,29"`)
  and are parsed; unusable → `price: null` / `total: null`; `quantity` defaults to 1 (and to 1 if not positive).
  Receipt total/payment lines are dropped before Gemini and before building candidates
  (`candidates.is_receipt_total`): the name must start with optional `sales`/`grand`/card-network prefixes
  plus a keyword (`total`, `subtotal`/`sub total`/`sub-total`, `tax`, `change`, `cash`, `card`, `balance`,
  `tender`, or a card network `visa|debit|credit|mastercard|mc|amex|discover`), followed only by amounts,
  `%`/currency/punctuation, masked card digits (`****1234`, `x1234`, `XXXX1234`) or the words `due, amount,
  amt, paid, tendered, tend, back, purchase, sale, savings, saved, auth, approved, chip, contactless` (or a
  card network). So `TOTAL 4.21`, `CHANGE DUE`, `VISA CREDIT ****1234` are dropped; `Total Cereal`,
  `Cash & Carry Crackers`, `Cashews` are kept. Coupon/discount lines follow the same rule with the keywords
  `coupon`, `discount`, `savings`, `instant savings`, `mfr` (`MFR COUPON`, `COUPON $1.00 OFF`; `off` is an
  allowed tail word), and any line with a **negative price** is dropped too (`candidates.is_receipt_noise`),
  since `POST /items` rejects negative prices.
- **Gemini category guide.** Every Gemini prompt that assigns a category (text parse, vision, receipt
  lines) carries the same definitions as `ml/yolo/taxonomy.py`: `produce_leafy` = short-life produce
  (greens, herbs, berries, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, bananas, avocados, papaya, pineapple...),
  `produce_hardy` = long-life produce (apples, citrus, pears, roots, onions, eggplant...), so Gemini and YOLO
  give the same shelf life for the same food. Transient Gemini errors (503 `UNAVAILABLE` "high demand",
  429, 504) are retried once after 1.5 s inside the same call (still one `gemini_usage` log line).
- ✅ `GET /items/barcode/:code` (6-14 digits, else 400) → `200 {candidate}` (Open Food Facts, adds
  `barcode`, `brand`, `quantity_text`); `404 not_found` unknown product; `502` OFF unreachable.

## Share / Food Pantry
`listing` = `{id, item_id, owner_id, group_id, status (open|fulfilled|cancelled), recipient_id,
claimed_by, created_at, fulfilled_at}`.
- ✅ `POST /share` `{item_id, group_id?}` → `201 {listing}` (`status=open`; writes a `share` event).
  No `group_id` = shared to the owner's accepted friends; `group_id` = shared to that group only.
  `403` not your item / not a member of `group_id`; `404` unknown item or group; `409
  already_removed` / `already_shared`; `400` for a group-pantry item (those cannot be shared).
- ✅ `GET /share` → `200 {listings: [...]}` — the Food Pantry, newest first. Open listings whose
  item is still active, **excluding your own**, that are either (a) a friends-listing by one of your
  accepted friends or (b) in one of your groups. Listings claimed by someone else are hidden; ones
  you claimed show with `claimed_by_me: true`. Each entry: `{id, item_id, owner_id, owner_name,
  group_id, status, claimed_by_me, created_at, source: {type: "friend"|"group", name}, item: {name,
  category, quantity, unit, predicted_expiry}}` (`source.name` = owner's display name for `friend`,
  group name for `group`).
- ✅ `DELETE /share/:id` → `200 {listing}` (`status=cancelled`). Owner only: `403` for a viewer who
  can see it, `404` if invisible/unknown, `409 listing_closed` if not open.
- ✅ `POST /share/:id/claim` → `200 {listing}` (`claimed_by` = you). `404` if you cannot see the
  listing, `400` your own, `409 already_claimed`, `409 listing_closed` (not open / item removed).
  The owner then removes the item with `outcome=donated` (optionally `recipient_id`; omitted defaults to the
  claimer, `null` means someone off BiteDown, a friend/group-mate id gives it to them), which sets
  the listing `fulfilled`. Restore reopens it with the claim intact (`recipient_id` cleared).

## Friends
Friendship is one row, requester → target; once accepted it is symmetric. Entry shape:
`{user_id (the other person), display_name, status, created_at}`.
- ✅ `POST /friends` `{email}` → `201 {friend}` (`status=pending`). `404` unknown email, `400` self /
  missing email, `409 already_friends` / `409 request_pending` (in either direction).
- ✅ `POST /friends/:user_id/accept` → `200 {friend}` (`status=accepted`). Only the target can accept:
  `404` when there is no pending request *from* `:user_id` to you.
- ✅ `GET /friends` → `200 {friends: [...], incoming: [...], outgoing: [...]}` (accepted; pending
  received; pending sent).
- ✅ `DELETE /friends/:user_id` → `204`. Removes the relationship in either direction and either
  status (unfriend / cancel / decline); `404` if none exists. Visibility ends immediately.

## Groups
`group` = `{id, name, role (owner|member — yours), member_count, invite_code, created_by,
created_at}`; `GET /groups/:id` adds `members: [{user_id, display_name, role, joined_at}]`. Invite
codes are 8 chars from `ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789` (no 0/O/1/I/L); joining is
case-insensitive and ignores spaces/dashes.
- ✅ `POST /groups` `{name (1-60 chars)}` → `201 {group}` (creator = `owner`).
- ✅ `GET /groups` → `200 {groups}` (mine only).
- ✅ `GET /groups/:id` → `200 {group}`; `404` unknown, **`403` not a member**.
- ✅ `POST /groups/join` `{invite_code}` → `200 {group}`; `404` bad code, `409 already_member`.
- ✅ `POST /groups/:id/leave` → `200 {left: true}`; `404` unknown, `403` not a member. If the owner
  leaves, the longest-standing member becomes owner. The leaver's open listings in that group are
  cancelled. Each of the leaver's **open** requests with this group as an audience loses only that
  audience; one whose only audience was this group is cancelled instead (its audience row is kept as
  history). Closed requests and other members' requests are untouched. A group whose last member
  leaves is kept but unreachable.
- ✅ `GET /groups/:id/pantry` → `200 {items}` — the group's active items by `predicted_expiry`, each
  an item plus `added_by` (display name). `404` unknown, `403` not a member.

## Request board
A request is one sticky note posted to one or more **audiences**: the author's accepted friends
and/or any groups the author is in. It is stored once and shows once on every audience's board.

`request` = `{id, author_id, author_name, text, status (open|fulfilled|cancelled), fulfilled_by,
fulfilled_by_name, created_at, audiences, source, group_id, group_name}`:
- `audiences` = `{friends: bool, groups: [{id, name}], hidden_count: int}`, **filtered to the
  caller**: `friends` is true only when the request has a friends audience and the caller is the
  author or one of the author's accepted friends; `groups` lists only audience groups the caller is
  currently in, sorted by name (case-insensitive) then id; every other audience is counted in
  `hidden_count` and never named or identified. The author normally sees everything
  (`hidden_count: 0`).
- `source` drives the sticky-note header: `me` (author, your display name); else `group` with the
  first group in `audiences.groups` when the caller sees any group audience; else `friend` (author's
  name).
- `group_id`, `group_name`: **deprecated** (kept one release for older clients): the first group in
  `audiences.groups`, or `null`.

- ✅ `POST /requests` `{text (1-280 chars after trimming), audiences: {friends?: bool (default false),
  group_ids?: [uuid] (default [], max 50)}}` → `201 {request}`.
  - At least one audience: `friends: true` or a non-empty `group_ids`, else `400 validation_error`.
    `400` also for a non-object `audiences`, a non-bool `friends`, a non-list (or `null`) `group_ids`,
    an entry that is not a UUID, more than 50 entries, or a body with both `audiences` and `group_id`.
  - `group_ids` is deduplicated (same UUID in any spelling counts once; first-seen order kept).
  - You must currently be a member of every group in `group_ids`: an unknown group **or** one you are
    not in is `404 not_found` (same answer, so group ids do not leak); nothing is written.
  - `friends: true` is allowed with zero friends (the note is visible to you until you have some).
  - **Deprecated (one release):** a body without `audiences` uses the old field: no `group_id` (or
    `null`) = `{friends: true}`; `group_id` = `{group_ids: [group_id]}` with the old errors (`404`
    unknown group, `403` not a member, `400` malformed).
- ✅ `GET /requests` → `200 {requests}` — open only, each request **once**, newest first (`created_at`
  desc, then id). Visible = the union of: your own; requests with a friends audience whose author is
  your **accepted** friend; requests with an audience group you are currently in. A fixed number of
  queries whatever the board size (your groups, your friends, the rows with authors, all their
  audiences in one query).
  - **`?mine=1`** (or `mine=true`): your own requests only, in **all** statuses (open, fulfilled,
    cancelled), newest first, same `{requests: [...]}` shape. Each carries `fulfilled_by` (the
    fulfiller's user id, or null) and `fulfilled_by_name` (their display name, or null), plus the
    `audiences` block (`hidden_count` is 0 unless you have since left one of its audience groups). Any other `mine` value (`0`,
    `false`, empty, junk) → `400 validation_error`. Without `mine` nothing changes (open only, union
    visibility). Fixed query count (groups, rows with authors, fulfillers, audiences).
    ```json
    {"requests": [{"id": "…", "author_id": "…", "author_name": "Me", "text": "Anyone have an onion?",
      "status": "fulfilled", "fulfilled_by": "<user id>", "fulfilled_by_name": "Ana",
      "audiences": {"friends": true, "groups": [], "hidden_count": 0}, "source": {"type": "me", "name": "Me"},
      "group_id": null, "group_name": null, "created_at": "2026-10-10T12:00:00Z"}]}
    ```
- ✅ `POST /requests/:id/fulfil` → `200 {request}` (`status=fulfilled`, `fulfilled_by` = you). `404`
  if you cannot see it (same visibility union), `403` your own, `409 request_closed` if not open.
  One fulfilment per request, whichever audience the fulfiller saw it through.
- ✅ `DELETE /requests/:id` → `200 {request}` (`status=cancelled`). Author only: `403` for a viewer
  who can see it, `404` invisible/unknown, `409 request_closed` if not open.

## People
- ✅ `GET /people/reachable[?item_id=]` → `200 {people: [{id, display_name, kind, groups, is_claimer}]}`:
  everyone the caller can hand food to (the same set `recipient_id` accepts on remove): accepted friends
  plus current members of the caller's groups, one entry per person, the caller excluded. `kind` is
  `"friend"` for an accepted friend (even if also a group-mate), else `"group_member"`. `groups` =
  `[{id, name}]` of the caller's groups that person is in (sorted by name; `[]` for a friend sharing
  none). Sorted by `display_name` (case-insensitive, then id). A fixed number of queries whatever the
  number of friends or groups.
  - `item_id`: when the caller owns the item (or can see it: group-pantry member, or the item's open
    listing is visible to them), the person who claimed its open listing gets `is_claimer: true` and
    sorts first. Only the owner is ever told the claimer; for a non-owner every `is_claimer` is
    false. No `item_id`, no claim, or a claimer who is no longer reachable → all false. Unknown or
    invisible item → `404`; malformed id → `400`.
  ```json
  {"people": [{"id": "…", "display_name": "Ana", "kind": "friend",
               "groups": [{"id": "…", "name": "Flat 4B"}], "is_claimer": true},
              {"id": "…", "display_name": "Ben", "kind": "group_member",
               "groups": [{"id": "…", "name": "Flat 4B"}], "is_claimer": false}]}
  ```

## Visibility rules (security core)
- Friend-scoped things (friends-listings, requests with a friends audience) are visible only to
  **accepted** friends of the author, plus the author. A request with several audiences is visible
  to the union of them, and its `audiences` field never names a group the caller is not in. Pending requests grant nothing; unfriending revokes at once.
- Group-scoped things are visible only to current members of that group.
- **Resource ids** (listing, request) you may not see return **`404`**, same as nonexistent, so
  existence does not leak. **Group-addressed endpoints** (`/groups/:id…`, a `group_id` in a body)
  return `404` for an unknown group and **`403`** for a group you are not in. Exception:
  `audiences.group_ids` on `POST /requests` returns `404` for both, since it is a list.
- Acting on a visible resource you lack the right for (cancel someone else's listing/request) is `403`.

## Recipes, impact, tips
- ✅ `POST /recipes/suggest` `{max_results?: 3 (1-10), dietary?: [str], item_ids?: [uuid] (1-10)}` → `200 {recipes: [{title,
  minutes, servings, uses_items, missing_items, steps, macros, macros_estimated}]}` built from the caller's
  20 soonest-expiring active items.
  - `item_ids` (optional): the items to cook now, 1-10 distinct uuids (`null` = not given). Any id that is not an
    active item of the caller (unknown, removed, someone else's) → `404 not_found` for the whole request, even with
    an empty fridge; a malformed list or id, more than 10, or duplicates → `400`. Those items are always sent to
    Gemini, even when they are not among the 20 soonest-expiring, flagged `must_use`, and every recipe must use at
    least one of them: this is an instruction to Gemini, the server does not check that a recipe obeys it (and
    `uses_items` matches names back soonest-first, so with two items of the same name the focus one may be reported
    as its twin). The order stays soonest-expiring first. The cache key includes the ids (in any order) only when
    given, so keys without them are unchanged. Works with `max_results` and `dietary`.
  - **Filtering (server side):** a recipe is dropped if its `title` is not a non-empty string or its `minutes`
    is not a number that rounds to an int in 1-600 (the app decodes both as non-null). `steps` and
    `missing_items` keep only their string entries and default to `[]`. Gemini is asked for
    `min(max_results + 2, 12)` recipes and the route cuts to `max_results` after filtering, so one bad recipe
    doesn't shorten the list. The cache key still uses the caller's `max_results`.
  - `servings`: int 1-20 from Gemini, else `null`.
  - `uses_items`: `[{item_id, name, predicted_expiry (date)}]` — Gemini's names mapped back to the
    caller's items (case/space-insensitive exact match, then containment; soonest-expiring wins; each
    item at most once per recipe). Names that match no item are dropped. `missing_items` stays `[str]`.
  - `macros` = `{kcal: int, protein_g, carbs_g, fat_g}` per serving, estimated by Gemini (validated:
    kcal 0-3000, grams 0-300, numeric); missing/invalid -> `macros: null` (no error).
    `macros_estimated` is always `true`.
  - **Cache:** per user, keyed by a SHA-256 of all the caller's active items (id, name, category,
    quantity, unit, expiry) plus `max_results` and `dietary`; TTL 6 h (`RECIPE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`, `0`
    disables). Any add/edit/remove/restore changes the key, so the next call goes to Gemini. In-process,
    shared by the single gunicorn `gthread` worker's threads (4 by default, `GUNICORN_THREADS`; lock-guarded; lost on restart). Each lookup logs one INFO line on
    `app.recipes.cache`: `recipes_cache status=hit age_s=<n>` or `status=miss reason=empty|items_changed|expired`
    (no user data). Errors (`502`) are not cached.
  - With no active items → `200 {recipes: []}` without calling Gemini; Gemini missing → `502`.
- ✅ `GET /impact?range=week|month|all` (default `all`; week=last 7 days, month=last 30; bad → 400) →
  ```json
  {"range": "week",
   "saved":   {"count": 3, "kg": 1.2, "money": 8.5, "co2e_kg": 2.1},   // used + donated
   "wasted":  {"count": 1, "kg": 0.5, "money": 3.5, "co2e_kg": 2.25},  // thrown_out
   "used":    {"count": 1, "kg": …, "money": …, "co2e_kg": …},
   "donated": {"count": 2, "kg": …, "money": …, "co2e_kg": …},
   "waste_rate": 0.25,
   "waste_reasons": [{"reason": "forgot", "count": 1, "kg": 0.5, "money": 3.5, "co2e_kg": 2.25, "share": 1.0}, …],
   "previous": {"saved": {…}, "wasted": {…}, "used": {…}, "donated": {…}, "waste_rate": 0.0},
   "weekly": [{"week": "2026-10-05", "saved": 3, "wasted": 1}],
   "last_6_weeks": [{"week": "2026-09-07", "used": 0, "donated": 0, "saved": 0, "wasted": 0}, …]}
  ```
  - `saved` = `used`+`donated`, so `saved.x == used.x + donated.x` (up to 2 dp rounding).
    `waste_rate = wasted.count / (saved.count + wasted.count)` (0 when empty).
  - `waste_reasons`: always all 4 reasons (`expired, didnt_like, forgot, other`), zero-filled, sorted by
    `count` desc (ties keep that enum order); `share` = count / `wasted.count` (0 when none). Same range.
  - `previous`: the same totals for the window of equal length just before the current one (week: 14..7
    days ago; month: 60..30 days ago); `null` for `range=all`. Clients compute deltas.
  - `weekly`: range-filtered weekly counts, only weeks with data (unchanged; zero data → `[]`).
  - `last_6_weeks`: **always 6 entries**, oldest first, ending with the current week, gap-filled with
    zeros, independent of `range`. Buckets are `time_bucket('1 week')` (Monday 00:00 UTC); `week` is the
    bucket start date. Counts only.
    Week dates (here and in `weekly`) are computed in UTC whatever the DB session time zone (BE-10).
  - Computed from `food_events` (`event_type='remove'`) on every request, never stored totals; money/kg/
    co2e rounded to 2 dp. A fixed number of queries, independent of data size (5 for `week`/`month`,
    including the window-start lookup; 4 for `all`). Zero data → zeros.
- ✅ `GET /tips` → `200 {tips: [{code, message}]}` (shape unchanged). Every `message` is a single
  line of at most 100 characters stating a fact about the caller's own data, never advice or an
  imperative. Event-based tips use the last **30 days** (rolling, same as `/impact?range=month`; was 90)
  of the caller's `remove` events; item names are trimmed to 30 characters (lists to 20 each, up to 3
  names then "and N more"). In this order, each only when it has data:
  | code | from | example |
  |---|---|---|
  | `past_expiry` | active items with `predicted_expiry` before today | "Ham is past the expiry date and still logged as in stock." |
  | `expiring_soon` | active items expiring today..today+2 | "Yogurt and Milk expire within 2 days." |
  | `top_wasted_item` | most thrown-out item name (case-insensitive) | "Cilantro went in the bin 3 times in the last 30 days." |
  | `top_reason_<reason>` | most common `waste_reason` | "3 of the 4 items you threw out in the last 30 days had expired." |
  | `top_wasted_category` | most thrown-out category, with money when known | "Leafy produce was thrown out most in the last 30 days: 3 items, about $10.50." |
  | `saved_recent` | `used` + `donated` count | "You used or donated 2 items in the last 30 days." |
  | `getting_started` | only when none of the above apply | "Nothing used, donated or thrown out in the last 30 days." |
  Ties: item by name, reason and category alphabetically. `top_reason_*` codes are unchanged
  (`expired`, `forgot`, `didnt_like`, `other`); `past_expiry` and `saved_recent` are new codes.

## Gemini timeouts
Every Gemini call sets an HTTP timeout so a hung request cannot pin one of the 4 gunicorn threads. Photo
enrichment uses `ENRICH_TIMEOUT_S` (25, no retry). All other calls (`parse_text`, `detect`, `receipt_categorize`,
`recipes`, `shelf_life`) use `GEMINI_TIMEOUT_S` (env, default 30 s per attempt). A transient error is retried once
after 1.5 s, so the worst case is 2 x 30 + 1.5 = 61.5 s, under gunicorn's 120 s `--timeout`. Keep
`GEMINI_TIMEOUT_S` at or below 55 so that stays true. A timeout is an `UpstreamError` (`502 upstream_unavailable`).

## Gemini usage logging
Every Gemini call (`parse_text`, `detect`, `receipt_categorize`, `recipes`, `shelf_life`, `enrich`) writes one INFO line on the
logger `app.gemini.usage` (its own stderr handler, so it shows in `docker compose logs api`):

    gemini_usage model=<model> purpose=<purpose> input_tokens=<n|null> output_tokens=<n|null> total_tokens=<n|null> latency_ms=<n> status=ok|error code=<http|null>

A response that is not usable JSON (unparseable, a scalar such as `null`/string/number/bool, or an
object whose `items`/`candidates`/`recipes`/`days` value is not a list) counts as a failed call
(`status=error`, one line) and the endpoint returns `502 upstream_unavailable` (BE-13); for the shelf-life
estimate on `POST /items` it falls back to the default table.
Tokens come from the response's `usage_metadata` (`output_tokens` includes thinking tokens); they are
`null` when it is missing, and on `status=error` when the call failed. `code` is the upstream HTTP status:
`200` on `status=ok`; on `status=error` the `.code` of the google-genai `APIError`/`ClientError`/`ServerError` (`code=429`), or
`code=null` when the failure carried none (timeout, network error, unusable JSON). Prompts, response text, user
data and the API key are never logged. Cost report:

    docker compose logs api | python scripts/gemini_cost.py
    python scripts/gemini_cost.py api.log --price gemini-3.8-flash=0.75,3.75 --default-price 0.75,3.75

`scripts/gemini_cost.py` prints calls, errors, tokens and USD per model + purpose and a total. Its
price table (USD per 1M input/output tokens) was verified against Google's pricing page on 2026-10-10;
`gemini-3.8-flash` and `gemini-3.6-flash` double on 2027-01-01 (to 1.50 / 7.50), so re-check before relying on it. Override per model with `--price MODEL=IN,OUT`.

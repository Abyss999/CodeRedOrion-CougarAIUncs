# Design

The live canvas for the key screens, made with Claude's Design canvas and following taste-skill's
rules, is at
**https://claude.ai/artifact/ALmB8FYKGrayhDQXqvoncx**. It's private, so the owner has to share it
before teammates can open it. The source of every artboard is mirrored in `screens/`. These are
`.dc.html` mockups, **not SwiftUI**. iOS translates them into native views using
`ios/App/Theme.swift`, the code mirror of [`DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`](DESIGN_SYSTEM.md).

Design read: a consumer iOS utility for students and shared households. Calm and practical, with a
fresh-produce palette and native iOS conventions (sheets, swipe actions, segmented controls,
system body type).

**Approval:** ✅ **Approved by the owner on 2026-10-10** (relayed through the Mac session), including feedback rounds 1–2, the native glass tab bar, "Use soon" and the colourful food-group icons. Wave 2 (iOS) has started. Changes requested
on the canvas get mirrored back into `screens/` and `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

## Owner feedback round 1 (2026-10-10), applied
- **Sign in:** less empty space. A value-points card now sits between the headline and the buttons.
- **Fridge:** items are grouped by **food group** (protein, veggies, fruit, ...), each with an icon. No emoji. Home's list uses the same icons.
- **Photo review:** every detected item has a **quantity stepper**. Expiry moved into the meta line.
- **Recipes:** **macros** per serving (kcal / protein / carbs / fat) on the best match, and kcal + protein on the other suggestions.

These need two backend additions (see `docs/API.md` once built):
- `food_group` on items and candidates.
- `macros` on recipe suggestions.

## Owner decisions, 2026-10-10 (round 2)
- **Native glass tab bar**, with Add as a tab. All tabbed artboards are updated.
- **`semi_fresh` is a product feature.** Food that's fine but should be eaten soon gets a **"Use soon"** badge on the Fridge, and "ripe, use soon" on photo review.
- **Food-group icons are colourful**, and the removal sheet header uses them too.
- **Approved on 2026-10-10.** Wave 2 started.

## Sign-in (owner decision, 2026-10-10)
- **Email and Google only.** Sign in with Apple was removed, because it can't be signed without a paid Apple Developer team.
- The landing screen keeps **Sign up / Log in** (green, as in the brief), then "or continue with", then a full-width **Continue with Google**. Sign up and Log in put Google first, then the email form.
- **Use Google's official button**: the Google Sign-In SDK button, or one built strictly to Google's branding guidelines (white, `#747775` border, `#1F1F1F` text, the official four-colour "G"). The mockups show the mark.
- Email: labels above the fields, a show-password toggle, the "At least 8 characters" hint, and inline errors under the field (Log in shows the error state). Forgot-password is **deferred**.

## Keeping the canvas in sync during Wave 2
The **orchestrator owns the canvas** and `docs/design/`, so there's a single writer and no publish conflicts. When an iOS PR deviates from an artboard, for a platform reason or a new state, the PR description includes a **"Design delta"** section: the artboard, what changed and why, plus a Simulator screenshot in `docs/qa/ios/`. The orchestrator updates the canvas and `screens/` to match when it merges the PR.

## Interaction notes for iOS
[`SCREENS.md`](SCREENS.md) is the per-screen contract and wins over this section; these are the cross-screen patterns.
- **Removal is one or two taps.** Swipe left on a row to reveal **Remove**, which opens the sheet.
  *Used it* finishes in one tap. *Shared it* shows a **Given to** menu (the claimer, friends, fellow
  group members, or "Someone not on BiteDown"; it defaults to the claimer, else "Someone not on
  BiteDown"), then Done. *Threw it away* pushes the reason list, where one tap finishes. A 5 s Undo
  follows. The Fridge's **Select** button opens multi-select (Used them / Shared them).
- **Tab bar (decided):** the native iOS 26 glass `TabView`. **Add is a tab** that presents the Add sheet and doesn't change the selected tab. There's no raised button.
- **Photo review** is the demo path's middle step. Snap your fridge → `POST /items/from-photo` →
  this screen → `POST /items`. Spoiled items sit in a **Looks spoiled** section with inline **Toss
  it** / **Keep it**, and "Add N" stays disabled until each is decided. Every other item is a
  `DetectedItemRow`, ticked by default, with one badge (an expiry range, "Use soon", or "Not sure"
  for low confidence) and a quantity stepper. No footer caption about estimates: the ranges already
  read as estimates. The primary button counts the ticked items.
- **Recipes** come from `POST /recipes/suggest`, opening on **Only what I have**. The best match is
  the hero card, with chips naming each expiring item it uses and how soon it expires ("Spinach ·
  Tomorrow"). The other suggestions are rows with a "Uses N" badge. A "You'll need" line shows only
  once "Only what I have" is off.
- The **Food Pantry** widget previews three food tiles and "+N more". Tapping it pushes Food Pantry.
- **Request notes** use two alternating fills and a slight rotation (±1.2° max). The header row
  always names the source (friend or group).
- The **Impact** chart is a stacked bar per week: saved (bottom) and thrown out (top), with a 2 pt
  surface gap. Values are labeled above each bar because the orange fails 3:1 against white.
  Build it with Swift Charts and add selection for per-week detail.

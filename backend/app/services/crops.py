"""Crops of detected food for the Gemini enrichment call (YOLO path only).

`bbox` comes from `ml/serve` in absolute pixels of the image *as that service decoded it*: RGB, no EXIF
transpose (`ml/serve/app.py::_load_image`). So a crop is cut from the raw pixel grid and then rotated upright by
the photo's EXIF orientation, so Gemini sees the food the right way up. If `ml/serve` ever starts transposing,
set `ML_BBOX_FRAME = "upright"` in the app config and keep the rotated-EXIF test in `test_crops.py` green.

Nothing here raises. Undecodable bytes, too many pixels, or a bbox that is missing, malformed, mostly outside the
image or too small give None for that item, and the enrichment still runs for it, text-only. The JPEG re-encode
drops all metadata (EXIF, GPS). Nothing is stored.
